# Encoding Fix - Emoji Removal

## Issue
Emojis in Python source files can cause `charmap` encoding issues on Windows systems and some environments that don't support UTF-8 by default.

## Solution
All emojis have been removed from Python (.py) files and replaced with text equivalents.

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `main.py`
**Changes**: Replaced emojis with text prefixes

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `üîç Reviewing PR` | `Reviewing PR` |
| `‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Issues` | `WARNING: Critical Issues` |
| `‚úÖ No critical issues` | `SUCCESS: No critical issues` |
| `üéØ DEMO MODE` | `DEMO MODE` |
| `‚ùå Invalid PR number` | `ERROR: Invalid PR number` |
| `‚ùå Invalid choice` | `ERROR: Invalid choice` |
| `‚ùå Error:` | `ERROR:` |

### 2. `services/email_service.py`
**Changes**: Removed emojis from email subjects

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `üîç Code Review Started` | `Code Review Started` |
| `üö® CRITICAL ISSUES` | `CRITICAL ISSUES` |
| `‚úÖ REVIEW COMPLETE` | `REVIEW COMPLETE` |

### 3. `nodes/pr_detector_node.py`
**Changes**: No emojis found (already clean)

---

## Verification

All Python files now use only ASCII-compatible characters for:
- Print statements
- Log messages
- Email subjects
- Error messages

---

## Benefits

1. **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works on Windows, Linux, Mac without encoding issues
2. **CI/CD compatibility**: No encoding errors in automated pipelines
3. **Terminal compatibility**: Works in all terminal types
4. **Email compatibility**: Email subjects display correctly everywhere

---

## Note

Emojis are still present in:
- Markdown documentation files (.md) - This is fine as they're not executed
- Comments in documentation - Safe for display purposes

Python source files (.py) are now emoji-free for maximum compatibility.

---

## Testing

To verify no encoding issues:

```bash
# Test on Windows
python main.py demo

# Test with different encodings
PYTHONIOENCODING=ascii python main.py demo

# Test email sending
python main.py pr owner repo pr_number
```

All should work without encoding errors.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed - All Python files are now encoding-safe
